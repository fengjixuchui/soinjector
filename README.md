This is a simple Linux library injector that allows you to inject a shared library into a running process. It uses `ptrace` to attach to the target process, call `dlopen` with the specified library path, and detach from the process.

## Download
You can get the latest stable binary from [here](https://github.com/meth1337/soinjector/releases/latest) (filename: `injector`)

## Usage
To use the injector, you must have root privileges. You can run the program with the following command:
```
sudo ./injector <lib_path> <pid>
```
Where `<lib_path>` is the path to the shared library you want to inject and `<pid>` is the process ID of the target process.<br><br>
Example:
```
sudo ./inject /path/to/libexample.so 1234
```
The injector will attach to the process, call `dlopen` with the specified library path, and detach from the process. If successful, it will print `[*] Library injected successfully!` to the console.

## Docs
The documentation of this tool is [here](https://github.com/meth1337/soinjector/wiki).
